#Noonightcoder Is You

Everyone working at Noonightcoder represents Noonightcoder. When a customer gets a respons from Sovath on support, Sovath is Noonightcoder. When a customer read a blog by Lux that our systems are down, Lux is Noonightcoder. In those siutations, all the other stuff we do to cultivate our best image is secondary. What's rigth infront of someone in a time of need is what they'll remember.

That's what we mean when we say "Walk the Walk" is everyone's responsibility, and that is pays to spend the time to recognize that. It's means taking the time to get the writing right and consider how you'd feel if you were on the other side of the interaction.

It also means that you're strongly encourage to help share your thoughts, experiences, and learnings on Noonightcoder culter book & our blog.
