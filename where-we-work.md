##Day to Day Communication

**Communication** is a key principle to success. "Having something to say & say it well" the more clear, concise, respectful, and consitent we are in communication as a team, the better! Especially, as a remote company, communication is critical. When in double, over-communicate.

**Our time + attention/focus is everything**...so we try together very hard to protect both. We don't do daily stand-up meetings, .We don't do pointless, useless meetings. A majority of our work requires big blocks of uninterrupted time. As result, it's important to give each other taht space be mindful of how our communication impacts someone's time, attention and focus. "FOCUS is POWER"

**Our default mode of communication is writing.** If you've got a new idea, thought,etc...best to write it up in own idea ðŸ’¡notes place or PM tool (i.e BaseCamp Message)! Sometime, obviously, writting doesn't always suffice. For brainstorming _ riffling, strategic conversation, tough converstations, one-on-one meetins, or all-team meetings, vidoes chats work-best.

**One-on-One Meetins:**

Periodically, we'll hop on a vidoe chat for about 1 hour with the person you work most closely with to get feedback o how things are going, discuss, issues that are though, mae sure priorities are aligned, riff + brainstorm on new ideas, etc. In the beginning, these will likely be weekly, or biweekly, and then later on, once a month. We can decide together whhat the best cadence is for you.

**All-Tem Meetings:**

Every month, we'll hold an all-team meeting via Zoom to reveiew the previous month (what went well, what didn't etc.), to outline priorities for the upcoming month + quater, to share learnings, and jsut to riff and catch up with one anohter. This is valuable time to get aligned as a company and to see each other's faces!
