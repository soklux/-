# What We Stand For

## Values

Before anything else, *VALUES* come first. Without clear, shared values we wander independently and contracdcit one another. Everything's harder when we all *BELIEVE* in different things about what's important to us, our company.

Key Value:

* **Be Straightforward** Whenever we spreak - internally or externally - we should speak plainly and clearly *CLARITY IS POWER* with "3R: real right reason". Watch out for lingo, assumptions, exaggeratio, or other things that get in the way of a straightforward explanation. This doesn't mean we stripe the poetry and personal expression from our language, but is' got to make sense. WIth the exception of deep techbnical discussions, anyone who read what we collectively write shoudl simply get it without further explanation required. Don't use eight words when five will do.

* **Be fair and do the right thing.** What's fiar? What's the right thing? We all have to use our best judgment, and everyone's judgement varies, but a good rule of thumb is "what would you do for a friend or a neigbor if they asked for help?" An example might be providng a refund even if it's a little outside the refund window. Or being someone who say 'Sure we can do that for you' when a customer expected you to say 'Sorry, we can't.' right thing! If that's gthe case, don't feel badly about it.


* **Levelheadeness** We should be calm, considered, and thoughtful in our dealings with each other and the world at large. We don't act of spite, we don't rush to judment, we don't jump to conclusion. If someone disagrees with us or attacks us we listen, we think, and we respond clamly and clearly - directly addressing the diea or the situation, not the perosonality, emotinally or the pressure or when agry.

* **Generousity & Kindess** Generosity is a wonderful vitue. Being generous is surprising someone on the other end with goodwill and asking for nonthing in return. It could be time, attenition, or treasure - we give what we're expected to, and then some.
